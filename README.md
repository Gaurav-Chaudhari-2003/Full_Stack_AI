# 🚀 Full Stack AI

Welcome to the **Full Stack AI** repository! This project tracks the journey of building end-to-end artificial intelligence applications, covering everything from data processing to model deployment.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into weekly modules, each focusing on a specific pillar of Full Stack AI development:

*   **`week1`** - Foundations and Environment Setup.
*   **`week2`** - Data Engineering & Exploration.
*   **`week3`** - Model Selection & Training.
*   **`week5_week6`** - Advanced Implementation & Integration.
*   **`pdf_to_img.ipynb`** - Utility tool for converting PDF documents into images for OCR or Vision-based tasks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages modern AI and Python tools:

| Category | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.12.7 |
| **Notebooks** | Jupyter / IPython |
| **Libraries** | `PyMuPDF` (fitz), NumPy, Pandas |

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📄 PDF to Image Extraction
One of the core utilities included is a robust script to extract high-quality images from PDF documents.
*   **Library:** `pymupdf`
*   **Functionality:** Automatically scans pages, identifies embedded images, and saves them to a structured directory for downstream AI processing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:
## 📦 Dependencies and Installation Guide

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you need to install several data science and machine learning libraries.

### 1. Required Packages
The following core libraries are used across the project:

| Package | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **numpy** | Numerical computing and array operations. |
| **pandas** | Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation. |
| **matplotlib** | 2D plotting and data visualization. |
| **seaborn** | Statistical data visualization. |
| **scikit-learn** | Machine learning models (Regression, Classification, Clustering). |
| **scipy** | Scientific computing and statistics. |
| **nltk** | Natural Language Processing (NLP). |
| **pymupdf** | PDF processing and image extraction. |
| **pillow** | Image processing. |
| **joblib** | Model persistence (saving/loading ML models). |
| **flask** | Web framework for model deployment. |
| **fastapi** | Modern web framework for building APIs. |
| **uvicorn** | ASGI server for running FastAPI apps. |

### 2. Installation Procedure

It is highly recommended to use a **Virtual Environment** to avoid conflicts with other system-wide packages.

#### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Open your terminal in the root of the `Full Stack AI` folder:






### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-Chaudhari-2003/Full-Stack-AI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired week:
   ```bash
   cd week1
   ```
3. Open your favorite IDE and start exploring!
